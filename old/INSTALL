Installation Notes
==================

SVN Sources
-----------

0) Maintainer setup

  You will need this software:

    autoconf >= 2.59
    automake >= 1.7
    gtk+ >= 2.6.4

  And running the following command on the source dir:

	$ autoreconf -f -i

  At this stage the source should be equivalent to the distributed tar
  source.

Distributed tar Sources
-----------------------

1) Configuring

	$ ./configure [options]

  For all available options see "configure --help". If you want to install
  later in a different directory you may be interested in the "--prefix"
  option.

2) Building

	$ make && make install
